# J.A.P.S (Just Another Portable Server)
ABOUT

JAPS is a brand new web server and web administration panel designed for individuals developing websites or web applications using pure PHP or HTML. While it shares some similarities with XAMPP, JAPS is tailored for a different use case.
Although XAMPP is widely recognized and used around the world, it lacks certain features that developers need to focus on web development. JAPS addresses this gap by removing features that the average user may not require and incorporating new functionalities that are essential for most developers.

FEATURES
    1.Start/Stop/Setup Server
    Similar to XAMPP, our server allows you to stop, change the port, and restart without closing the panel or manually editing the configuration files.
    2.Project-Based Workspace
    Unlike XAMPP, which stores all files in a single root folder, JAPS enables users to set up a dedicated workspace for each project. This allows each project to operate independently, eliminating the need for manual navigation.
    3.Auto Index Selector
    In contrast to XAMPP, every created workspace in JAPS comes with a default HTML or PHP file. As long as you name the file index.html or index.php, the program will automatically assign it as the default webpage, with PHP taking priority.
    4.Custom Error Messages
    You can create your own custom error messages for various HTTP status codes, such as 403, 404, 402, and 401.
